    <h1>Welcome To Web Design Module!!</h1>
    <p>HyperText Markup Language is the computer language that facilitates website creation. The language, which has
        code words and syntax just like any other language, is relatively easy to comprehend and, as time goes on,
        increasingly powerful in what it allows someone to create. HTML continues to evolve to meet the demands and
        requirements of the Internet under the guise of the World Wide Web Consortium, the organization that designs and
        maintains the language; for instance, with the transition to Web 2.0.

        HyperText is the method by which Internet users navigate the web. By clicking on special text called hyperlinks,
        users are brought to new pages. The use of hyper means it is not linear, so users can go anywhere on the
        Internet simply by clicking on the available links. Markup is what HTML tags do to the text inside of them; they
        mark it as a specific type of text. For example, markup text could come in the form of boldface or italicized
        type to draw specific attention to a word or phrase.</p>
    <p>What Is HyperText Markup Language (HTML)?
        HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the set of markup symbols or codes inserted into a file intended for display
        on the Internet. The markup tells web browsers how to display a web page's words and images.

        Each individual piece markup code (which would fall between "<" and ">" characters) is referred to as an
            element, though many people also refer to it as a tag. Some elements come in pairs that indicate when some
            display effect is to begin and when it is to end. KEY TAKEAWAYS HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the
            basic scripting language used by web browsers to render pages on the world wide web. HyperText allows a user
            to click a link and be redirected to a new page referenced by that link. Early versions of HTML were static
            (Web 1.0), while newer iterations feature a great deal of dynamic flexibility (Web 2.0, 3.0). Markup is the
            text that appears between two pointed brackets (e.g., ), and content is everything else. </p>
            <p>What is CSS?
                CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
                CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
                CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
                External stylesheets are stored in CSS files

                CSS Saves a Lot of Work!
                The style definitions are normally saved in external .css files.

                With an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one
                file!

            </p>
            <p>JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

                JavaScript's dynamic capabilities include runtime object construction, variable parameter lists, function variables, dynamic script creation (via eval), object introspection (via for...in and Object utilities), and source-code recovery (JavaScript functions store their source text and can be retrieved through toString()).
                
                This section is dedicated to the JavaScript language itself, and not the parts that are specific to Web pages or other host environments. For information about APIs that are specific to Web pages, please see Web APIs and DOM.</p>
