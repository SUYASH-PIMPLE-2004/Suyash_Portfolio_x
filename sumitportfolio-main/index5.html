    <h1>Welcome To 3D Printing Design 4</h1>
    <p>
        Three-dimensional (3D) printing is an additive manufacturing process that creates a physical object from a digital design. The process works by laying down thin layers of material in the form of liquid or powdered plastic, metal or cement, and then fusing the layers together.
        3D printing is a process in which a digital model is turned into a tangible, solid, three-dimensional object, usually by laying down many successive, thin layers of a material. 3D printing has become popular so quickly because it makes manufacturing accessible to more people than ever before.
        Conclusion. 3D printing technology is a major on the original manufacturing technology, which is slowly changes our production and life, but also plays an extremely important role in cultural creative design, industry, biological and medical fields.
